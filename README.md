# CodeAlpha_LoginAndRegistrationSystem
This is a Login and Registration System implemented in C++. It allows users to register with a username and password, stores their credentials in a file (users.txt), and enables them to log in later. The system checks if a username already exists and ensures passwords meet basic security requirements.
